	    <h2>About me</h2> 
		    <p> 
		Hi, I’m Chelsea! I grew up in Chongqing, China, and have spent the last seven years in California (five years in Santa Barbara 
	and two in Orange County). My background bridges technology and the humanities, allowing me to approach information 
	challenges from both technical and human-centered perspectives. From 2021 to 2023, 
	I worked as a Product Analyst in an insure-tech startup, where I led data analysis to improve profitability 
	and customer experience, building narratives with data to inform decision-making. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in 
	Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley. I’m focused on exploring the intersection of information 
	technology and human society, particularly in areas like algorithm fairness and ethical AI. In my free time, I enjoy 
	photography, music (I'm learning guitar!), visiting museums, and watching sunsets by the beach.
